# Paraphrase Identification

---

**Paraphrase Identification** is an task to determine whether two sentences have the same meaning, a problem considered a touchstone of natural language understanding.

Take an instance in MRPC dataset for example, this is a pair of sentences with the same meaning:

sentence1: Amrozi accused his brother, whom he called "the witness", of deliberately distorting his evidence.

sentence2: Referring to him as only "the witness", Amrozi accused his brother of deliberately distorting his evidence.


Some benchmark datasets are listed in the following.

## Classic Datasets

|  Dataset    | pairs of sentence |

- [**MRPC**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52398&from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdownloads%2F607d14d9-20cd-47e3-85bc-a2f65cd28042%2Fdefault.aspx) is short for Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus. It contains 5,800 pairs of sentences which have been extracted from news sources on the web, along with human annotations indicating whether each pair captures a paraphrase/semantic equivalence relationship.
- [**SentEval**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05449.pdf) encompasses semantic relatedness datasets including
SICK and the STS Benchmark dataset. SICK dataset includes two subtasks SICK-R and SICK-E.
For STS and SICK-R, it learns to predict relatedness scores between a pair of sentences. For SICK-E, it has the same pairs of sentences with SICK-R but can be treated as a three-class classification problem (classes are 'entailment', 'contradictionâ€™, and 'neutral').

- [**Quora Question Pairs**](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs) is a task released by Quora which aims to identify duplicate questions. It consists of over 400,000 pairs of questions on Quora, and each question pair is annotated with a binary value indicating whether the two questions are paraphrase of each other.

A list of neural matching models for paraphrase identification models are as follows.
